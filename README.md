# Tradebot

#This is a complete pet project to master pyhton as hobby. The project is to automate crypto trading from an exchange using rest api. It will buy and sell crypto automatically by scheduled python scripts via microsoft schedulers on daily basis. It will check if there is growth and alert via watsapp using twilio. Remember Idea was to master phython and not trading. So invest only on amount which you can afford to loose. The world we are living is psycial and not virtual, so don't let your savings lying virtually somewhere. There is no perfect auto-trade-bot, possible hence manual check will still be needed
